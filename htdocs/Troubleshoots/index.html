    <h1> game no workie? </h1>
    <h3> Well lets see whats wrong</h3>
    <p> so sometimes your game will not work for some reason and thats why this exists </p>
    <p> number one it gives an error might be ebcause you didnt reload the game with the reload bit when it gives an error just hit reload and it will be fine</p>
    <p> number two it takes a while for the game to load so be paitent and cry about it</p>
    <p> number three 500 internal server error right click on the frame where the game would normally be and hit reload frame it should work</p>
    <p> and thats all i have for you buh-bye </p>
