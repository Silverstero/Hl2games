    <h1> FAQ/Troubleshooting</h1>
    <p class="haha"> well lets see if we can fix it</p>
    <h4>1. i can access the front page but not any other games</h4>
    <p> that means that the backend were all of our games are have been blocked. we currently have no way to fix this. </p>
    <h4> ok so why are all of your games on a diffrent repo? </h4>
    <p> takes 10-20 minuntes for this to deploy when we have all of our games on the frontend. when we dont use that method and i only need to update this end i can without any issues </p>
    <h4> 2. why am i getting redirected to your backend when i try to play a game</h4>
    <p> i do not use iframes because they suck. plus its alot better because it fits the whole frame instead of a box in the middle</p>
    <h4> 3. why do you not have spotify, youtube, coolmathgames, and things like that.</h4>
    <p> we do not have these things as i cant get a proxy for those things to work maybe in some date i will get one.</p>
    <h4> 4. why do you not have back buttons on your site?</h4>
